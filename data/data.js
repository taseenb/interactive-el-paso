    "intro-text": "Bold, exuberant and full of flavour, it’s not hard to understand why the UK has fallen for Mexican cuisine. What’s harder to fathom, for a style of cooking that is so simple and intuitive, is why we are confident ordering Mexican food in a restaurant, but flummoxed when it comes to re-creating the dishes in the kitchen. But don’t panic – just start with one simple ingredient and then add your own twist. So get inspired with our interactive guide.",

        "history": "The corn tortilla came first, a thin unleavened bread made from ground maize, and predating the European arrival in South America. Spanish Jews brought in the flour tortilla, made with European (kosher) wheat, rather than maize.",
        "tip": "Make your own corn tortillas by mixing masa harina, salt, water and olive oil to make a dough. Flatten and cook in a frying pan before wrapping the tortilla around your favourite filling. Try haddock coated in spices, or squash and courgette for a veggie alternative."
